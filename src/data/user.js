				Hi, I'm Abhiram. I create dynamic, cross-platform React and React Native apps.
				I value the importance of producing high-quality, scalable, and maintainable
				code. To achieve this, I focus on <strong>code refactoring, thorough reviews, clear
				documentation, reusable components, scaffolding, and modular design.</strong>
				My goal is to work with a team of like-minded individuals with a similar set
				of interests. My journey into programming began eight years ago in high
				school when I was introduced to C++ as a core academic subject.
				<br />
				<br />
				I have one year of professional programming experience at Deloitte
				Consulting, where I developed scalable solutions using Java and .NET for
				real-world challenges. Moreover, I have five years of experience building
				dynamic and user-friendly applications as part of my academic pursuit in the{" "}
				<strong>Mobile App Development Postgraduate Diploma</strong> and{" "}
				<strong>Bachelor's in Computer Applications</strong>.
